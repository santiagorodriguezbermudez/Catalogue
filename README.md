# Catalogue

A webapp that consists of a catalog, that is, a browsable list of items that you can filter and access to the details of one item. It uses a Public API to fetch the data that it renders. 

## About

You can filter by exchange or search directly for your preferred stocks. Moreover, you can select them and view their historical price.
